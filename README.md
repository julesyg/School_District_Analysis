## School District Analysis

Multiple methods of analysis were utilized to find the data requested. Specifically, we examined the reading and math scores

may need more resources for their educational programming. 

NOTE: This assignment was completed based on the questions on this worksheet. The information on the bootcampspot module
varies slightly.
